#  Follows WestWood 2026 startup.  Starting with 'sim'

Startup:
    MentorBot (main robot class) init is called
        Records "Robot" as logger meta data
        Does RobotMode 'match' (which we are in sim)
        Starts the logger

        Creates the RobotContainer()        # We create the robotcontainer during RobotInit

            Creates all the subsystems      # **** Does something special if in replay?
                                            #      sort of 'IO' init only...
                DriveSubsystem
                    sets  self.io = DriveIO()
                    sets  self.inputs = DriveIO.DriveIOInputs()
                    sets lots of initial values

                    if simulation.
                        creates a sim VelocityGetter. (NetworkTable subcription)   ***
                        which is tied to the 'chassis speed' function that has an
                        @autolog_output set
            Register 'Alerts'
            sets 'shiftAllerts set to true'

    RobotInit() is called'
        sets signal logging auto-log to False
        disables all livewindow telemetry
        sets up Command auto-log capabilities for initialize finish and interrupt

        sets up some pathplanner logging

    Since simulation PhysicsEngine is initialized:
        Their drive sim does not use CTRE's built in simulation. So may need this
        for us on another project.

        Calls RobotState class method and has these that is connect to
            Registers SIM reset listeners.
            Registers SIM Pose listeners.
            TODO: Any usefulness for this in our code (the logic)
            TODO: Could be useful if we can restart simulation or if this is need for replay and we
                do not have to reload.

        Almost immediately, get a call to 'chassisSpeeds' due to NT4 update. This acceses
        a 'fieldSpeeds' attribute of the drivetrain. This is a class from the wpilib kinematics
        module. Also is available in pathplanner, but drivetrain uses wpilib.

        Looking at our existing code. Have the ctre Telemetry hooking into pathplanner as well but
        we have that disabled. So getting what it has and what westwood has may be something
        that would be very useful.

        ** I accommodated for it in our 'drive' command that centralizes manual driveing

        Aside.  Here is what they have auto-logged with the @autolog_output in their drivetrain
                Note that the prefix is 'Robot' or 'drive' and tends to tell if measurement is robot-centric
                or field-centric.

            getSwerveExpectedState()(key="drive/swerve/expected") -> Tuple[SwerveModuleState]

            getRobotRelativeSpeeds()(key="Robot/relSpeeds") -> ChassisSpeeds

            getFieldRelativeSpeeds()(key="Robot/speeds") -> ChassisSpeeds

            getModuleStates()(key="drive/swerve/real") -> Tuple[SwerveModuleState]

            getAngularVelocity()(key="Robot/velocity") -> RadiansPerSecond

            chassisSpeeds()(key="drive/fieldSpeeds") -> ChassisSpeeds
                Called on manual drive updates and from the waypoint command. We
                have this in our 'drive' command.  Should be okay here but may
                want to dig into their command structure some more

          For direct calls in drivetrain code to 'Logger' functions we have:
             'periodic' -> Logger.processInputs and others
             'arcadeDriveWithSpeeds' -> drive/swerve/commandedSpeeds  Tied into waypoint command
                                and drivewithpathplanned (which is their callback in pathplanner config init)
