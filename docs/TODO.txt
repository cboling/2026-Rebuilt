# Here are some must haves

Determine all the command mappings to the controllers. Make a PowerPoint
set of slides that we can update as needed

Figure out actual MAX_SPEED and MAX_ANGULAR_SPEED

Implement multiple possible auto-path commands.  Need to come up with a good
coordinate and base/fixed paths that we can pull together.

Get vision working  (Aim at tag, follow tag around)  Focus on Limelight first.
Photonvision is a second option but may need more work.

Get auto aim and shoot command implemented

Come up with more than one shooting position. Best if it could be an algorythm

Is the HolonomicDrive class used anywhere?   Clean up or get rid of it

Support FieldLimits in the 'ResetXY' command.  Need to confirm tha this is the
center of our robot and do appropriate checks on space

Do we want to support pitch and roll in our logged gyro outputs. Seems like this
would be useful since we have a bump and may help us figure out how to get off
a ball underneath

Need an automated command that will get us off of a ball if in auto or teleop
we get trapped. Will rely upon lots of testing to figure out a good mechanism.

Test for odometry overshoot for yaw and see how best to adjust or compensate for it
Will need to be done when robot is complete empty and with fuel load in it

Re-examine all drive and command code and make sure we have FieldCentric and
RobotCentric properly set or compensated for.

For the shooter, there is a Rev Client that may help us parameterize the values
for the closed loop controller.

Do we need a different Autonomous MAX speed?

Once logging works. Drop our 'stats' capability

=================================================================================
# Here are some things that are outstanding (but not needed or may not have the time)

Get AdvantageScope reading our logs.  Order is:
    - Can read real logs
    - Can read sim logs
    - Can work with running robot (live)
    - Can work with simulated robot (live)
    - Can do replay-simulation with 2d and/or 3d of real or sim logs

Vibrate controller feedback?



LoggedDashboardChooser is provided by pykit. Change all Sendable Choosers to
use this.

Westwood project has a 'drive-with-path-planned' that works with path planner and
will log the chassis speed each time called. Determine if this is critical for pykit
integration

For the default pykit w/ pathplanner, it had a k_pathplanner_holonomic_controller
and there was a PPTLVController defined. Did not see much mention in other projects
about this. Look to see what it does and how it could help

pykit has some SysIdRoutines defined as did the default project built by Tuner-x
See what we need if we have some time

Test 'GotoPoint' command. see if we can tie it into pathplanner and have
it traverse from the neutral zone to our alliance zone to shoot.

After GotoPoint is understood. Does SwerveToPoint provide a better way if we
combine that with pathplanner.

For field selector, make that chooser work and update the fields. This is future
of course

For Drive command, look into the 'square' and 'rate_limit' optional parameters.

Add vision logging support

Add other subsystem logging support (shooter, intake, indexer, climber)
